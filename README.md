# Physics-Simulator-2D
Physics Simulator 2D (PhySim2) is a restricted collection of 2-Dimensional Continuous Physical Simulations, written using the Mighty SFML !

PhySim2 includes dynamical simulations of Double Pendulum, Triple Pendulum, Butterfly Effect (using 10,000 Double Pendulums), Elliptical Billiards and Tearable Cloth.

Integration Methods: Semi-Implicit Euler (Triple Pendulum, Butterfly Effect), Verlet Integration (Elliptical Billiards, Tearable Cloth), Classic Runge-Kutta / RK4 (Double Pendulum).

SFML installation required prior to compilation of the simulator.
